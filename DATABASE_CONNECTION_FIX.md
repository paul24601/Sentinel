## Database Connection Fix Summary

### Issue
The application was failing on the server with "Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'" errors because several PHP files were using hardcoded local development database credentials instead of the production configuration system.

### Files Updated

#### Core Files Fixed:
1. **`dms/submission.php`** (line 27)
   - ✅ Replaced hardcoded connection with centralized DatabaseManager
   - ✅ Updated secondary connections for DMS and sensory data

2. **`parameters/submission.php`** (line 21)  
   - ✅ Replaced hardcoded connection with centralized DatabaseManager
   - ✅ Maintained timezone setting for Philippine Time

3. **`dms/fetch_cycle_times.php`** (line 11)
   - ✅ Updated to use centralized configuration

4. **`dms/fetch_auto_cycle_time.php`** (line 11)
   - ✅ Updated to use centralized configuration

### Production Database Configuration
The system now correctly uses the production database credentials defined in `includes/config.php`:

```
Database: u158529957_spmc_injmold
User: u158529957_spmc_injmold  
Host: srv1518.hstgr.io
```

### How It Works
1. Environment detection automatically determines if running on production vs local
2. Production environment uses individual database credentials for each service
3. Local environment continues to use XAMPP/root credentials
4. DatabaseManager class handles connection pooling and error handling

### Verification Steps
After deployment, test these URLs to verify connections:

1. **Parameters Submission**: `/spmc/injection/parameters/submission.php`
2. **DMS Submission**: `/spmc/injection/dms/submission.php`  
3. **Cycle Times**: `/spmc/injection/dms/fetch_cycle_times.php`
4. **Auto Cycle Time**: `/spmc/injection/dms/fetch_auto_cycle_time.php`

### Remaining Files with Hardcoded Connections
The following files still have hardcoded connections but may need individual assessment:

- `sensory_data/` directory files (various fetch scripts)
- May need updating if they're causing production issues

### Next Steps
1. Deploy the updated files to production
2. Test the applications to ensure database connections work
3. Monitor error logs for any remaining connection issues
4. Update remaining sensory_data files if needed
