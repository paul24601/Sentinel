## SQL File Syntax Fix Summary

### Issue Fixed
The SQL file had syntax errors due to trailing commas in INSERT statements that were not properly terminated with semicolons. This happened when records were removed during the cleanup process, leaving incomplete INSERT statements.

### Specific Problems Found:
1. **Trailing commas in INSERT statements** - Lines ending with `,` instead of `;` before section separators
2. **Incomplete INSERT statements** - Missing data that was removed during user cleanup
3. **Missing semicolons** - INSERT statements not properly terminated

### Fix Applied:
Used PowerShell regex to systematically replace trailing commas before section separators (`-- --------------------------------------------------------`) with semicolons.

**Command used:**
```powershell
$content -replace '(\(.*?\)),(\s*\r?\n\s*-- --------------------------------------------------------)', '$1;$2'
```

### Verification:
- ✅ All INSERT statements now properly terminated with semicolons
- ✅ No trailing commas before section separators  
- ✅ No empty parentheses or incomplete statements
- ✅ SQL syntax should now be valid for import

### Next Steps:
1. **Test import** - Try importing the SQL file to your database server
2. **Backup first** - Always backup existing data before importing
3. **Monitor for errors** - Check for any remaining syntax issues during import

The file should now import successfully without the MariaDB syntax error you encountered!
