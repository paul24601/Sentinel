# Production Report System Revision

## Overview
The Production Report System has been updated to support two distinct report types:

### 1. **Finishing Report**
For finishing operations and assembly processes including:
- Assembly Line processes
- Painting operations
- Polishing
- Packaging
- Quality Check
- Other finishing processes

### 2. **Injection Report**
For injection molding operations including:
- Injection Molding Parameters
- Process-specific controls
- Material specifications

## Key Features Implemented

### Report Type Selection
- Radio button selection at the top of the form
- Dynamic form sections that show/hide based on selection
- Clear visual indicators for each report type

### Finishing-Specific Fields
- **Finishing Process**: Dropdown selection (Assembly, Painting, Polishing, Packaging, Quality Check, Other)
- **Station Number**: Text field for workstation identification
- **Work Order #**: Work order tracking
- **Tools/Equipment Used**: Text field for equipment documentation
- **Quality Standard**: Quality requirements specification

### Injection-Specific Fields
- **Injection Pressure (MPa)**: Decimal input for pressure settings
- **Molding Temperature (Â°C)**: Integer input for temperature
- **Cycle Time (seconds)**: Decimal input for cycle timing
- **Cavity Count**: Integer input for mold cavities
- **Cooling Time (seconds)**: Decimal input for cooling phase
- **Holding Pressure (MPa)**: Decimal input for holding pressure
- **Material Type**: Text field for material specification
- **Shot Size (g)**: Decimal input for shot weight

### Common Features (Both Reports)
- Basic Information (Plant, Date, Shift, Hours)
- Product Details (Name, Color, Part No)
- ID Information (ID Numbers 1-3, EJO #)
- Assembly Line Information
- Quality Control Records Table
- Downtime Records Table
- Remarks Section

### Database Schema Updates
The `production_reports` table now includes:
- `report_type` ENUM field ('finishing', 'injection')
- All injection-specific fields with appropriate data types
- All finishing-specific fields
- Proper indexing for performance

### User Interface Improvements
- Smooth transitions between report types
- Visual styling for report type selection
- Conditional display of relevant form sections
- Maintained responsive design

### Backend Processing
- Updated submit.php to handle new fields
- Proper data validation for report types
- Database insertion with type-specific data
- Error handling for missing required fields

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files:
1. `production_report/index.php` - Added report type selection and conditional form sections
2. `production_report/submit.php` - Updated to handle new fields and report types
3. `production_report/database.sql` - Updated schema with new fields

### New Files Created:
1. `production_report/update_database.php` - Database update script
2. `production_report/update_database.sql` - SQL update script

## Installation/Update Process

1. **Database Update**: Run the `update_database.php` script to add new fields to existing tables
2. **Clear Cache**: Clear any cached files if applicable
3. **Test Both Report Types**: Verify both Finishing and Injection reports work correctly

## Usage Instructions

1. **Select Report Type**: Choose between Finishing or Injection at the top of the form
2. **Fill Common Fields**: Complete the basic information section
3. **Complete Type-Specific Fields**: Fill the appropriate section based on selected report type
4. **Quality Control**: Add quality control entries as needed
5. **Downtime**: Record any downtime incidents
6. **Submit**: Submit the completed report

## Benefits of This Revision

- **Organized Data Collection**: Separate fields for different operation types
- **Improved Efficiency**: Users only see relevant fields for their process
- **Better Reporting**: Type-specific data enables better analytics
- **Scalability**: Easy to add more report types in the future
- **User Experience**: Cleaner, more intuitive interface

## Future Enhancements

- Data visualization specific to each report type
- Export functionality with type-specific templates
- Advanced analytics comparing Finishing vs Injection metrics
- Role-based access to specific report types
- Automated report scheduling and distribution
